Notes:
-Make sure to input the map name as the exact file name i.e. "small_map.txt"
-map name is case sensitive.
-All command inputs must be capitalised during the period of the game i.e. "MOVE W" or "LOOK". otherwise "Fail" is outputted
-"quit" can be inputted to exit the map selection

OOP has been demonstrated through the use of private attributes which means that encapsulation of attributes for each Class is maintained.

I have also implemented inheritance through the use of the Bot class which inherits from the HumanPlayer class which reduces redundant 
repetition as the Human Player shares similar attributes to the CPU.

I have used Polymorphism by adjusting the "look" method in the Bot which adjusts it to replicate the view of the Bot
rather than the player's POV.
